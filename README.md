### What is Huahua-name? ###

The goal of the application you are building is to let users buy names and to set a value these names resolve to.
The owner of a given name will be the current highest bidder. In this section, you will learn how these simple
 requirements translate to application design.

We have used the [nameservice](https://github.com/deus-labs/cw-contracts/tree/main/contracts/nameservice) code that we have improved.
